# ShadowRunner
Simple sidescrolling ios game

This code is almost 3 years old. Anyone coming accross this please note it will compile and run without errors. However the images are the wrong size and dimensions and size/speed calculations need to be redone. I'm probably going to rewrite it in Swift. So while the basics work, you won't want to take it as scripture to write your own side scrolling game.

Just keeping this project and files for reference.
